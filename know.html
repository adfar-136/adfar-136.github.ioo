                 <h2>While the skills of coding have revolutionized all the parts of globe:</h2>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Kashmir has an unemployment rate higher than the average national unemployment rate.</li>
                     <li>The gap between the logical and reasoning IQs of the kids from the valley versus outside of valley is increasing by the day due to the absence of curriculums updated to the needs of the present time.</li>
                     <li>Majority of the opportunities of generating income after graduating high school and college lie in jobs unrelated to education or government sector.</li>
                     <li>Youth of Kashmir are still suffering a great deal because of lack of appropriate private sector opportunities.</li>
                     <li>Majority of the businesses still run offline and have trouble shifting their enterprises online.</li>
                     <li>There is a drastic lack of web and application developers in the valley and this lack of tech savvy people is pushing Kashmir back by ages.</li>

                 <h1>Why coding for kashmiri kids?</h1>
                 <p>For Kashmiri children, studies have become a real struggle. It has now become such a drag that they feel imprisoned by this idea of education. And while the education sector is trying hard at maintaining a sustained existence and impact on literacy rate of the region, we have all seen it fail time and again. An additional factor could also be the frequent time offs due to the political situation and climate of the valley.

As such coding is not only a better alternative but a tool that will boost the morale of Kashmiri kids. Coding is a fun exercise. Everything that a child studies can be visualised in real time on a computer screen. And since kids already know games, it's only right that we tell them how to create one.

It is not just a process of making genius computer engineer out of kids, coding increases the IQ and CQ of children regardless of the area they are interested in. Studies have proved that coding not only increases mathematical aptitude but also the creative quotient of a student.

So regardless of the field of interest, anyone can take up coding and learn atleast the basics of computer science. Afterall we are already living through a time where lives are affected by computerss in manifold.

Scientific studies by various organisations have also revealed that children achieve a peak in their creativity around the age of 6 which is followed by a gradual decline.

So that's why not only should we encourage kids to take up coding but also learn it as an important academic activity.</p>
